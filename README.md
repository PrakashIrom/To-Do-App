What the app will do?
The app can store the task which the user needs to do in the future with date and time. 
According to the date and time the app will give notification to the user.

Tools and Technologies used:
Kotlin Jetpack Compose, Android Studio.

Library used:
ViewModel, ROOM DB, Coroutine, Alarm Manager, Notification Manager, DataStore<Preferences>.

Issue: Even after the user has chosen the date and time for giving reminders, the notification doesn't come. I need to fix this.
